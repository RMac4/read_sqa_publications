# Background
The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) [publish official statistics and other information](https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/48269.html) on a regular basis. In line with the [Code of Practice for Statistics](https://code.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/), a rolling 12-month [publication schedule](https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/48513.html) is available, with an exact date of publication provided at least four weeks in advance of publication. Further information is [available on the SQA website.](https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/92537.html)

This code extracts the data contained within the data tables to allow for analysis by users.

# Limitations

The code will only work for SQA statistical publications with the updated excel layout, this will exclude publications prior to 2022.

# R Packages

The following R packages are required to be installed:

- openxlsx
- dplyr
- purrr
- httr
- stringr

# Workflow

Run each of the following sections in order:

-   Load packages and source functions.
    -   **Description**: Loads required R packages and functions for reading data tables.
-   Collect data
    -   **Description**: Creates the file patch for the data tables and extracts sheet names, data tables, and notes to a nested list. Can be set to a web link or local file path.
    -   **Scripts**: Runs the R script `extract_publication_data.R`.
    -   **Output**: Outputs a nested list `publication_output` in the R environment.
-   Split data
    -   **Description**: Splits data collected in 'Collect data' section.
    -   **Output**: Outputs a list of data called `tables` in the R environment, as well as data frames called `sheets` and `notes`.

# Project structure/archive

The parent directory is an RStudio project initiated as a git repo and includes the associated admin files (`.gitignore` and `read_sqa_publications.Rproj`) at the top level. It also contains the following sub-directory and a taskmaster file:

## `R/`

-   `extract_publication_data.R`
    -   contains a function `extract_publication_data()` that creates a file path to the location of an SQA statistical excel publication either from the web or on the local device and then extracts the sheet names, data tables, and notes of an SQA statistical excel publication to a nested list.

## `read_published_tables.R`

Script which runs to collect data, calling other scripts in `R/`. Contains some variables which will need updated.
